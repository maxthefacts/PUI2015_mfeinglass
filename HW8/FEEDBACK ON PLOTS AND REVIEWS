NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
==================

too many caegories make it hard to read in a single plot

the year label is far too small

it is not clear what the touch of red means at the top of the plot

the color is lost in color blind cases to 10% of males cannot read your plot


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
================================

===========

nice color scheme, robust to color blindness 

the hour labels are too small

"hour" should be "time of day" to comply to "weekday"

Xiaoge270
=======
3D completely confuses the message. 3D plus obstruction and overlap makes the plot unreadable. 

color unexplained

gender is not a fractional value so all but 0 and 1 tick labels should be removed and 0 and 1 substituted with male and female

class is also integer: one must remove the .5 labels

mcleanalec
==========

very small axis labels

background choice is distracting and reduces the visibility of the line, which however remains visible enough

it is an extremely simple plot, which however shows a very strong and interesging trend.

(it was wrongly label HW7)
