Max Feinglass Review of Gloria (Xiaoge) Wu's Vizulization


I liked your visualization!  I had a few thoughts:
-The title is a little clunky.  Survive v Non-Survive can be better phrased as “Mortality”
-There is no key!  I don’t know what the red dots mean, I do not know what the green dots mean.
-I am not sure what the scale for gender is.  What does it mean to be 0.6 gender?
-I am not sure what to take away from the graph.  The 3-D aspect is interesting but a little confusing.  I can’t see immediately what one variable’s impact is on another.  
-The title intrudes on the graph space
-Its hard to tell green and red apart.  The dots are so close together, it makes it hard to distinguish what is what.
-Why does it matter that the visualization is in 3-D?  I don’t imminently get it.

You did a good job!
