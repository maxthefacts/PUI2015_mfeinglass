I loved your plot.  I thought it as really great and pretty easy to read.  Here are some suggestions for making it even better:
-Relabel the x-tickts the actual days of the week instead of the numbers that are there now.
-Increase the size of the x-labels and y-labels, they are a little hard to read
- Take out the words “using heat map” from the title of the graph, it’s a little redundant

I thought this was a fantastic visualization.  Good job!
