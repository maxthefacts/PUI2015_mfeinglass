I liked your plot.  The background color is a little jarring to the eyes, what is that some sort of metallic fill?  
It would nice to have some xtickts to give us a sense of where we are along the xaxis.  
Also smoothing the line to give us a sense of continuity could also be a cool idea.  
You might want to make the tittle of the graph a little farther above the top line of the plot, to give a sense of space.
Finally, making the labels larger so we don’t have to squint to read the axis lettering would be great.  
I liked the green outline of the splines!  
Over all, it is was pretty great.  Good job!

I thought this was a fantastic visualization.  Good job!
