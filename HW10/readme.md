I had some trouble with this notebook.  2 Issues.  First, I could not get the zip package to work on my windows machine.  I therefore manually unzipped the files and imported directly from the txt files.  I have uploaded these txt files to github.  Please don’t be too harsh-I have python installed in two places and figuring out how to install packages has always been a problem.

Next, I could not figure out how to plot my data onto Manhattan.  I went to colleagues, and they insisted my code was correct.  I believe it is something wrong with my package.  I hope it runs on your machine.
